Analysis on IRS data and relations between AGI and Mortgages

--------------------



# OVERVIEW:



We would like to study and make an analysis from the IRS data set and pull and predict the relationship between AGI and mortgages in USA.

We are planning to use the data of IRS from https://www.irs.gov/uac/SOI-Tax-Stats-Individual-Income-Tax-Statistics-ZIP-Code-Data-(SOI). On this data we are going to look at relations between AGI and Mortgages they take, the interest payed on them and how it in different states of America is. We are planning to cluster the results using K means clustering to see if there are can do any data analysis on data. To see if there are any commonalities in between states and differences in between states. Classify states which are performing on a similar basis and which are preforming differently.





# DATA:

We take Data driven of IRS from https://www.irs.gov/uac/SOI-Tax-Stats-Individual-Income-Tax-Statistics-ZIP-Code-Data-(SOI). 



We are going to pull the dataset from different years from the above link and use ZIP Code data to show selected income and tax items classified by State, ZIP Code, and size of adjusted gross income.









# RESEARCH QUESTIONS:



We would like to research different points like retrieve data and clean it and remove the unwanted bits.

 Create explanatory graphs and see the relations between AGI and mortgage interest payed.

 Preform K means clustering on this data and see which states and moving together and which are out of the pack. 

Find out any commonalities or differences in the data.



Research on the analysis on IRS data and relations between AGI and Mortgages would pull the economic status of the individuals how they are paying their taxes from different states and helps to understand the different state economic status.







# MODELS AND ANALYSIS:



We are planning our models and preliminary analyses will be performed in a Jupyter Notebook and development in python.

 







# CODE AND APPLICATION



Soon, we will build our initial coding and post the code in our GitHub repository and instructions on installation are in the README.md file at the root level.





# PROJECT MANAGEMENT:



We are team of Six, Srikanth Budi, Venkateswara R Kotha, Sai Bharadwaja Uppala, Sundeep Vuyyuru, Keshava Paruchuri, Tarun Madugoni, we will be sharing our work amoung ourselves. Srikanth & Venkateswara will be taking care of development, data analysis , Back end work consisted of an API that was created to provide data to the front end. And Writing O Auth script to pull linked in Connections and Bharadwaja, Sundeep, Tarun and Keshava would work on data set, data analysis and UI development and together we are collaborating to check the progress of the project testing.
